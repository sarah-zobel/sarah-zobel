I’m @sarah-zobel, a linguist working in formal semantics, pragmatics, and their interfaces. 
In order to collect data for my research, I use text corpora and conduct experimental studies, in addition to informal interviews with native speakers.

Here on GitHub, my goal is to make available some of the code I wrote over the years.
